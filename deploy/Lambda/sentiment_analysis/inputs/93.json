I asked for an email address and he told me to look on my confirmation email. The email address from the confirmation email didn't work. I had to spend another $15 to get the correct edition of the book. I'd already paid more for the book that I got than it would have been worth brand new. I will NOT purchase from this distributor again.", "file_name": "93", "recognized_text": "__label__1 Mistake?: I ordered the Penguin edition for this book five weeks before my grad class started.
